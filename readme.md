# sqs-receive-channel [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bendrucker/sqs-receive-channel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bendrucker/sqs-receive-channel) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/bendrucker/sqs-receive-channel?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/bendrucker/sqs-receive-channel)

This package (`package sqsch`) provides a channel-oriented interface for processing messages from an SQS queue. 

SQS charges per API request. This package implements [Horizontal Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-throughput-horizontal-scaling-and-batching.html#horizontal-scaling) and [Action Batching](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-throughput-horizontal-scaling-and-batching.html#request-batching) as recommended by the SQS docs to make efficient use of API calls. This allows you to write applications that can handle both high throughput and long idle periods effectively.

* Fetches as many messages (`ReceiveMessages`) as the receive channel's buffer can fit
  * 0 (full): no requests are issued
  * 1 to 10: a single request is issued
  * 10+: multiple requests are issued concurrentlyâ€”all must complete before the loop can continue
* Uses [SQS long polling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-long-polling.html) to reduce requests when no messages are available
* Deletes messages in batches
  * When 10 messages are enqueued for deletion via the delete channel (the maximum batch size)
  * After `Delete.Interval` (e.g. 1s), regardless of whether any other messages can be deleted in the batch
  * Will issue as many concurrent batch deletion requests as specified in `Delete.Concurrency` (default: 1)

## Usage

```go
import (
  "context"
  "time"

  "github.com/bendrucker/sqs-receive-channel"
)

func main() {
  receive, delete, errs := sqsch.Start(context.TODO(), sqsch.Options{
    ReceiveBufferSize: 10,
    DeleteInterval: time.Duration(1) * time.Second
  })

  go func() {
    message := <-receive
    fmt.Println(message.Body)

		// SQS DeleteMessageBatch API will be called after:
		// a) 1 second or b) 9 more messages are processed
    delete <- message
  }()

  go func() {
    err := <-errs
    fmt.Println(err)
  }()
}
```

## Example

The following example illustrates the API calls made by this package in a "bursty" application. This scenario envisions a queue that is mostly idle, but receives large numbers of messages on occasion.

* Configuration: `ReceiveBufferSize=10, DeleteInterval=time.Duration(1)*time.Second`,
* Queue is idle for 55 seconds
* 10 messages become available
* All messages are read from the receive channel immediately
* All messages are handled and sent to the delete channel within 100ms

The following API requests will be performed in the first 60s:

* 4 calls to `ReceiveMessage` (2 that return empty, 1 that returns 10 messages, and then 1 that remains open at 1:00)
* 1 call to `DeleteMessageBatch`, containing 10 message handles

Compared to a naive approach (1 request per message, short polling), this can reduce requests to the SQS API by a considerable margin (1-3 orders of magnitude). Results will vary depending on throughput.
